This is a formative exercise (i.e., does not count towards final grade) practicing the basic concepts about classes.
In this exercise, you will experiment with C++ in a way that will (hopefully) help understand the concept of classes. The idea of the exercise builds towards the other practicals.
Further instructions are included in main.cpp.
Please download the following files:

main.cpp
makefile
InputHelper.h
InputHelper.cpp
main.sol

You have to complete the file main.cpp.
The makefile will attempt also to build a main.
main.sol is an executable of my implementation that you could play with.
You have to download it and change it to an executable (chmod main.sol 755).
