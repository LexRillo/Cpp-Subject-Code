This is a formative exercise (i.e., does not count towards final grade) practicing the notion of constructors.
In this exercise, you will add further functionality to your basic vector.
Further instructions are included in Vector.h.
Please download the following files:

main.cpp
makefile
Vector.cpp
Vector.h
VectorTester.cpp
VectorTester.h

You have to complete the files Vector.h and Vector.cpp.
You should probably rely on your implementation from practical 1.
Running the tests is just like in practical 1.
