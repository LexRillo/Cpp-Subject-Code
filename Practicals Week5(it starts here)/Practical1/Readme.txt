This is a formative exercise (i.e., does not count towards final grade) practicing the basic concepts about classes.
In this exercise, you will construct a basic container for integers based on arrays.
Further instructions are included in Vector.h.
Please download the following files:

main.cpp
makefile
Vector.cpp
Vector.h
VectorTester.cpp
VectorTester.h

You have to complete the files Vector.h and Vector.cpp.
The makefile will attempt also to build a main file that tests your program.
The way to run the test is:
./main e d c b a
or just
./main a
./main b
and so on.
