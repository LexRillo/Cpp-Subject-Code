# Cpp-Subject-Code
 Practical Code of the C++ Course from the University of Leicester 2017-18
 
 The practicals are just simple examples for learning the basics of C++ (constructors, data structures, etc.)
 
 The coursework section contains the exercise, the solution I came up with and the test suite.
 
 Assignment1 -> Complete the model of an Automaton using dynamic memory allocation.
 
 Assignment2 -> There are two tasks for this assignment. First one is to use inheritance to construct the classes for different bank types. Second one uses inheritance to construct a system that parses boolean formulas. For instance it can parse "(not (true or false))" and return the result.
 
 Assignment3 -> There are two tasks for this assignment. First one is to use templates to construct a takes tasks with different priorities and returns them according to which priority is selected. Second one uses Takes a set of map directions to construct the path that a point when given said instuctions. The map is text base but expands (through dynamic memory) depending on how far the path is taken.

Requirements:

-Linux

-g++ compiler


To run the program:

1. Go to the directory containing the file through command line

2. Compile by using "sudo g++ -o 'nameofthefile' 'nameofthefile'.cpp"

3. Run by using "./'nameofthefile'"


Most of the programs will be run using main.cpp
