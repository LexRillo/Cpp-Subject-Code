This is a formative exercise (i.e., does not count towards final grade) practicing the notion of templates.
In this exercise, you will change your vector and linked list to be template classes.
Please download the following files:

LinkedList.h
LinkedListTester.h
main.cpp
makefile
Vector.h
VectorTester.h

You have to complete the files Vector.h and LinkedList.h.
You should probably rely on your implementation from practical 4.
Running the tests is just like in previous practicals. The tests go up to w.
