This is a formative exercise (i.e., does not count towards final grade) practicing the notion of inheritance, virtual functions, and object oriented design.
In this exercise, you will create classes for Shape, Rectangle, Square, and Circle.
Further instructions are included in the header files.
Please download the following files:

Circle.cpp
Circle.h
main.cpp
makefile
Rectangle.cpp
Rectangle.h
Shape.cpp
Shape.h
ShapeTester.cpp
ShapeTester.h
Square.cpp
Square.h

You have to complete the files Shape.h, Shape.cpp, Circle.h, Circle.cpp, Rectagle.h, Rectangle.cpp, Square.h, and Square.cpp
Running the tests is just like in previous practicals (up to f).
