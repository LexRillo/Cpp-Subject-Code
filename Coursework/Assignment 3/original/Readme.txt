A forum has been set up for questions regarding this assessment. Check out here.

Exercise 1 (60 marks)
In this exercise you will practice the usage of templates and the standard template library. You are asked to implement a version of a simple priority queue where items come into the queue with two different priorities and can be extracted as the first according to hte first priority or the first according to the second priority. The details regarding the implementation of this class are given in the Priority.h header file. As this is a template class all implememtation is included in the header file.

I have set up Priority.h with the signature of the class.

The supplied file main.cpp includes a basic usage of the Priority class.

Exercise 2 (30 marks)
In this exercise you will create a more complicated system that uses the standard template library.

I have set up Path.h and Path.cpp with the signatures of the classes and skeletons for their implementations. Obviously, your main task is to complete the implementation.

The supplied file main.cpp includes a basic usage of the Path.
