This is a formative exercise (i.e., does not count towards final grade) practicing the notion of constructors.
In this exercise, you will add further functionality to your basic vector and create a LinkedList container.
Further instructions are included in Vector.h and LinkedList.h.
Please download the following files:

LinkedList.cpp
LinkedList.h
LinkedListTester.cpp
LinkedListTester.h
main.cpp
makefile
Vector.cpp
Vector.h
VectorTester.cpp
VectorTester.h

You have to complete the files Vector.h, Vector.cpp, LinkedList.h, and LinkedList.cpp
You should probably rely on your implementation from practical 2.
Running the tests is just like in practicals 1 and 2. The tests go up to q this time.
